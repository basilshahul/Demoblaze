### Demoblaze Design Approach 
Performed automation testing by implementing a **BDD Design Pattern** with a well-structured folder and dependency structure. Further HTML reports and Extent Spark Reports are generated rendering them an invaluable resource for thorough analysis. Adequate webdriver waits and exception-handling strategies are provided.
